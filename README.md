# 2DSurvivorsCourse

Learn how to create a complete 2D arena survival roguelike game from start to finish in Godot engine 4!

Not an official repo, here I am just following the Godot course by [Firebelley Games](https://www.udemy.com/user/firebelley-games/) and using the Tiny Dungeon assets by [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl)
